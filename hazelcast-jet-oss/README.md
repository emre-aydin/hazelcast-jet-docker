# Hazelcast Jet Docker Images

[Hazelcast Jet](http://jet.hazelcast.org) is a distributed computing
platform built for high-performance stream processing and fast batch
processing. It embeds Hazelcast In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) to provide
a lightweight package of a processor and a scalable in-memory storage.

Visit [Hazelcast Jet Website](http://jet.hazelcast.org) to learn more
about the architecture and use-cases.

## Hazelcast Jet Quick Start

For the simplest end-to-end scenario, you can create a Hazelcast Jet cluster with two Docker containers and access it from the client application.

```
$ docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dhazelcast.local.publicAddress=<host_ip>:5701" -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
$ docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dhazelcast.local.publicAddress=<host_ip>:5702" -p 5702:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-jet

## For Hazelcast Jet Management Center
$ docker run -p 8081:8081 hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-management-center
```

Note that:
* each container must publish the `5701` port under a different host machine port (`5701` and `5702` in the example)
* `<host_ip>` needs to be the host machine address that will be used for the Hazelcast communication

After setting up the cluster, you can start the client application to check it works correctly.

## Hazelcast Jet Defined Environment Variables

### JAVA_OPTS

As shown below, you can use `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable if you need to pass multiple VM arguments to your Hazelcast Jet member.

```
$ docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512M -Xmx1024M" hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
```

## Configuration

### Using Custom Hazelcast Jet Configuration File

If you need to configure Hazelcast Jet with your own `hazelcast-jet.xml`, you need to mount the folder that has `hazelcast-jet.xml`. You also need to pass the `hazelcast-jet.xml` file path to `hazelcast.jet.config` in `JAVA_OPTS` parameter. Please see the following example:

```
$ docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dhazelcast.jet.config=/opt/hazelcast-jet/config_ext/hazelcast-jet.xml" -v PATH_TO_LOCAL_CONFIG_FOLDER:/opt/hazelcast-jet/config_ext hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
```

### Using Custom Hazelcast IMDG Configuration File

Similar to providing custom Hazelcast Jet configuration, If you need to configure the underlying Hazelcast IMDG instance with your own `hazelcast.xml`, you need to mount the folder that has `hazelcast.xml`. You also need to pass the `hazelcast.xml` file path to `hazelcast.config` in `JAVA_OPTS` parameter. Please see the following example:

```
$ docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dhazelcast.config=/opt/hazelcast/config_ext/hazelcast.xml" -v PATH_TO_LOCAL_CONFIG_FOLDER:/opt/hazelcast/config_ext hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
```


### Extending CLASSPATH with new jars or files

If you have custom jars or files to put into classpath of docker container, you can simply use `CLASSPATH` environment variable and pass it via `docker run` command. Please see the following example:

```
$ docker run -e CLASSPATH="/opt/hazelcast-jet/CLASSPATH_EXT/" -v PATH_TO_LOCAL_CONFIG_FOLDER:/opt/hazelcast-jet/CLASSPATH_EXT hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
```

### LOGGING_LEVEL

The logging level can be changed using the `LOGGING_LEVEL` variable, for example, to see the `FINEST` logs.

```
$ docker run -e LOGGING_LEVEL=FINEST hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
```

Available logging levels are (from highest to lowest): `SEVERE`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `CONFIG`, `FINE`, `FINER`, and `FINEST`. The default logging level is `INFO`.

Note that if you need more custom logging configuration, you can configure your own `log4j.properties` file by mounting it into your container like below:

```
$ docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dlog4j.configuration=file:/opt/hazelcast-jet/ext-logging-config/log4j.properties" -v PATH_TO_LOCAL_CONFIG_FOLDER:/opt/hazelcast-jet/ext-logging-config hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
```

### Managing and Monitoring

You can use JMX or Prometheus for the application monitoring.

#### JMX

You can use the standard JMX protocol to monitor your Hazelcast Jet instance. Start Hazelcast Jet container with the following parameters.

```
$ docker run -p 9999:9999 -e JAVA_OPTS='-Dhazelcast.jmx=true -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9999 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false' hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
```
Now you can connect using the address: `localhost:9999`.

#### Prometheus

You can use JMX Prometheus agent and expose JVM and JMX Hazelcast Jet metrics.

```
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PROMETHEUS_PORT=8080 hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
```

Then, the metrics are available at: `http://localhost:8080/metrics`. Note that you can add also `-e JAVA_OPTS='-Dhazelcast.jmx=true'` to expose JMX via Prometheus (otherwise just JVM metrics are visible).

## Hazelcast Jet Management Center
